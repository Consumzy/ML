<h1 align="center">Consumzy: Manage Your Food for Easy</h1>

---
# Our Goal
>An object detection model for the identification of the name of the food or ingredient for managing food expiration. Food waste is a common problem that affects both households and industries. While industries may have established methods for preserving food, households however lack knowledge on how to store food effectively and how long it can last. Furthermore, people tend to forget the ingredients they have and when they purchased them, which can lead to further food waste. To tackle these challenges, our team developed an app that allows people to manage their food inventory at home, including the option to share excess food with their community. This app aims to provide greater accessibility and reduce food waste in households.
